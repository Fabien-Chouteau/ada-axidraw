   --  Time is represented as a Modified Julian Day number plus fraction of a
   --  day within the range of dates defined for Ada.Calendar.Time.  The small
   --  of the type preserves the precision of type Duration (64 bits).

   --  We introduce type Modified_Julian_Day so that expressions will be
   --  cleaner when we want the operations from Standard as opposed to those
   --  defined in Ada.Calendar on type Time.

   --  The Julian Day approach simplifies Time_Of and Split substantially, as
   --  well as being well-known algorithms.  The use of the Modified Julian Day
   --  number allows us to preserve the precision of type Duration.

   --  Time zones are not supported in this implementation

   --  Modified Julian Day.  The range is exactly that of the dates supported
   --  within the constraints on the components that make up a date.
